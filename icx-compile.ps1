    Multiple, feature specific auto-dispatch code paths for Intel速 processors.
    The /Qax option tells the compiler to find opportunities to generate separate versions of functions that take
    advantage of features of the specified instruction features.
    If the compiler finds such an opportunity, it first checks whether generating a feature-specific version of a
    function is likely to result in a performance gain. If this is the case, the compiler generates both a feature
    specific version of a function and a baseline version of the function. At runtime, one of the versions is chosen
    to execute, depending on the Intel速 processor in use. In this way, the program can benefit from performance
    gains on more advanced Intel processors, while still working properly on older processors and non-Intel
    processors. A non-Intel processor always executes the baseline code path
